            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3.[7].Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early
                childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education.
                It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender,
                caste, religion, language, and disability.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as
                improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion
                rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability,
                promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by
                various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy
                2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Empowering you to achieve your goals</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a
                state subject; states possessed full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies. After
                the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent
                list.[8] This allowed the central government to recommend education policies and programmes, even if
                state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes.[8] In a
                country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast
                differences between states in terms of their policies, plans, programmes and initiatives relating to
                school education.
